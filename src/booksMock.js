Após uma série de confrontos, Jane é enviada para um colégio interno, onde conhece seus primeiros momentos de verdadeira felicidade. Crescida e formada como professora, ela decide procurar uma nova posição, e no Solar de Thornfield, passa a ser a tutora da jovem Adèle, pupila de Lord Rochester. Quando conhece Rochester, apaixona-se por ele, e ele por ela. Este lhe propõe casamento e ela aceita, mas no dia de seu casamento, Jane descobre um terrível mistério que assola o Solar de Thornfield. Desiludida, foge e após dias vagando sem destino é recolhida por St John Rivers e suas irmãs. É pedida em casamento por Rivers, entretanto hesita e, antes de dar uma resposta, decide descobrir o que acopnteceu com Lord Rochester, pois não teve mais notícias dele desde que fugiu de sua casa. Encontra-o ferido e sozinho no Solar de Thornfield, destruído, morando em companhia de empregados ainda fieis.',

        description:
          'A BELIEF IN FREE WILL touches nearly everything that human beings value. It is difficult to think about law, politics, religion, public policy, intimate relationships, morality—as well as feelings of remorse or personal achievement—without first imagining that every person is the true source of his or her thoughts and actions. And yet the facts tell us that free will is an illusion. In this enlightening book, Sam Harris argues that this truth about the human mind does not undermine morality or diminish the importance of social and political freedom, but it can and should change the way we think about some of the most important questions in life.',

        description:
          "This book grew out of my search for understanding of my reactions to a colleague who aroused considerable frustration and anguish in practically everyone this person encountered. However, none of us talked to each other about it and I continued to engage in much self-examination, looking for my unresolved issues that could be making me react so strongly to this person. Nothing I could think of seemed to fit, so I continued to try to dissolve my resistance and defenses, all to no avail. A meeting with colleagues started me on a more fruitful path. The meeting was on a professional concern, but I happened to make a comment that I went home and took two headache pills after a recent conversation with the distressing colleague. I was surprised to hear from every person at the meeting (about ten people) that they, too, had headaches or stomachaches every time they interacted with the person. Although we didn't spend much time recounting our reactions and experiences, I realized that part of the problem was the other person. That realization sent me to the literature, and what emerged was the description for the destructive narcissistic pattern. Everything fit, including the personal reactions I'd had with the colleague. Researching causes and development of the destructive narcissistic pattern (DNP) led me to reflect about the effects on a child when either one or both parents had the pattern. As I continued to explore the research, I began to better understand some of my personal experiences and those that many of my students and clients had reported. Many of their adult reactions, behaviors, and attitudes could be a result of having one or more parents who had a destructive narcissistic pattern. Out of these realizations and experiences emerged this book. But understanding was not enough. If what I'd learned was to truly be helpful, I needed to find a way not only to explain the destructive narcissistic pattern in ways that would be easy to understand, but to provide some personal growth strategies as well. What I wanted to do was to give people some resources for providing themselves with the parenting they needed but did not receive. This was my challenge and what follows is my attempt to provide some understanding and guidance.",

        description:
          'A groundbreaking approach to transforming traumatic legacies passed down in families over generations, by an acclaimed expert in the field Depression. Anxiety. Chronic Pain. Phobias. Obsessive thoughts. The evidence is compelling: the roots of these difficulties may not reside in our immediate life experience or in chemical imbalances in our brains—but in the lives of our parents, grandparents, and even great-grandparents. The latest scientific research, now making headlines, supports what many have long intuited—that traumatic experience can be passed down through generations. It Didn’t Start with You builds on the work of leading experts in post-traumatic stress, including Mount Sinai School of Medicine neuroscientist Rachel Yehuda and psychiatrist Bessel van der Kolk, author of The Body Keeps the Score. Even if the person who suffered the original trauma has died, or the story has been forgotten or silenced, memory and feelings can live on. These emotional legacies are often hidden, encoded in everything from gene expression to everyday language, and they play a far greater role in our emotional and physical health than has ever before been understood. As a pioneer in the field of inherited family trauma, Mark Wolynn has worked with individuals and groups on a therapeutic level for over twenty years. It Didn’t Start with You offers a pragmatic and prescriptive guide to his method, the Core Language Approach. Diagnostic self-inventories provide a way to uncover the fears and anxieties conveyed through everyday words, behaviors, and physical symptoms. Techniques for developing a genogram or extended family tree create a map of experiences going back through the generations. And visualization, active imagination, and direct dialogue create pathways to reconnection, integration, and reclaiming life and health. It Didn’t Start With You is a transformative approach to resolving longstanding difficulties that in many cases, traditional therapy, drugs, or other interventions have not had the capacity to touch.
